## Problem Statement: 
In todayâ€™s context, we are dealing with a vast amount of unstructured image data from cameras and sensors. Image classification is one of the fundamental problems in the field of computer vision.

By using knowledge from SC1015 and convoluted neural networks, we seek to apply image classification on landscape images to identify 6 landscapes, namely Sea, Glacier, Forest, Buildings, Mountain and Street.


## Model Used 
- Convolution Neural Network
